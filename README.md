# 🧠 Mental Health in the Tech Industry

In This project, I have analyzed the results of a 2014 survey that measures attitudes toward mental health and the prevalence of mental health disorders in the tech workplace.

## 📊 Dataset Information

- **Source**: [Kaggle - OSMI Mental Health in Tech Survey (2014)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-survey/data)
- **Description**:  
  The dataset includes responses from tech workers about mental health, workplace support, treatment history, and openness to discussing mental health issues. It provides insight into how mental health is perceived and handled in the tech industry.

## 🔍 Objectives

- Explore trends and patterns in mental health attitudes across different demographics.
- Analyze how workplace culture affects mental health support and disclosure.
- Identify areas where mental health support could be improved in tech workplaces.
## 🧪 Key Analyses Performed

- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, standardizing categories.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Demographics, mental health treatment trends, employer support.
- **Visualization**: Bar plots, Box plot, Scatter Plot, and pie charts using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
- **Insights**:
  - Employees are more likely to seek help when employers provide resources.
  - Younger age groups report higher openness about mental health.
  - Many employees are unsure whether their workplace supports mental health issues.

## 📌 Tools & Libraries

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git/GitHub

## 💡 Future Improvements

- Survey was conducted in 2014 with limited dataset (27 columns & 1259 rows)
- Mostly US data was collected for this survey
- Although the survey was specifically designed to be conducted in the tech field, there are close to 18% of the companies belong to the non tech field. 
- Require recent data to get a clear picture of the mental health in tech company, because after Covid working conditions changed a lot
