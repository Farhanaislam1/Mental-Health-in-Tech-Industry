# 🧠 Mental Health in the Tech Industry

This project analyzes the results of a 2014 survey that measures attitudes toward mental health and the prevalence of mental health disorders in the tech workplace.

## 📊 Dataset Information

- **Source**: [Kaggle - OSMI Mental Health in Tech Survey (2014)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-survey/data)
- **Description**:  
  The dataset includes responses from tech workers about mental health, workplace support, treatment history, and openness to discussing mental health issues. It provides insight into how mental health is perceived and handled in the tech industry.

## 🔍 Objectives

- Explore trends and patterns in mental health attitudes across different demographics.
- Analyze how workplace culture affects mental health support and disclosure.
- Identify areas where mental health support could be improved in tech workplaces.
## 🧪 Key Analyses Performed

- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, standardizing categories.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Demographics, mental health treatment trends, employer support.
- **Visualization**: Bar plots, heatmaps, and pie charts using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
- **Insights**:
  - Employees are more likely to seek help when employers provide resources.
  - Younger age groups report higher openness about mental health.
  - Many employees are unsure whether their workplace supports mental health issues.

## 📌 Tools & Libraries

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git/GitHub

## 📈 Sample Visualizations

`e.g. ![Openness to Mental Health Disclosure](visuals/disclosure_chart.png)`

## 💡 Future Improvements

- Build a dashboard using Power BI or Tableau for interactive visual analysis.
- Use machine learning to predict likelihood of seeking treatment based on demographics and workplace support.
- Compare with more recent OSMI datasets (e.g., 2020+).
